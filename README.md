This is a machine learning-based project built to predict the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) innings in T20 cricket matches. The model uses real-time match inputs like venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, bowler, current score, overs, wickets, and last 5-over performance to forecast the projected final score.

üìå Project Highlights

Achieved an impressive 90% accuracy in predicting scores compared to actual match results.

Trained on a rich dataset containing 76,015 records of IPL match data.

Developed a clean, user-friendly front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask with dropdown menus for teams, venues, players, and real-time match inputs.

Built and saved Label Encoders for venue, teams, players to handle categorical variables.

Deployed a TensorFlow Keras regression model for score prediction.
