# IPL Score Predictor Using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning-based project built to predict the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) innings in T20 cricket matches. The model uses real-time match inputs like venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler to forecast the projected final score.

# 📌 Project Highlights

1) Achieved an impressive 90% accuracy in predicting scores compared to actual match results.

2) Trained on a rich dataset containing 76,015 records of IPL match data.

3) Developed a clean, user-friendly front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask with dropdown menus for teams, venues, players, and real-time match inputs.

4) Built and saved Label Encoders for venue, teams, players to handle categorical variables.

5) Deployed a TensorFlow Keras regression model for score prediction.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

1) Python

2) TensorFlow / Keras

3) Flask

4) HTML, CSS (front-end)

5) Pandas, NumPy

6) Scikit-learn (Label Encoding)

7) Joblib (Model and Encoder serialization)

# 📌 Workflow

1️) Data Collection and Preprocessing

2️) Feature Engineering (overs, wickets, etc.)

3️) Model Training and Evaluation (TensorFlow Keras model)

4️) Encoders creation for venue, teams, and players

5️) Front-end development using HTML & CSS with Flask integration

6️) Model Deployment with interactive form inputs

# 📊 Key Features

1) Predicts final score of a T20 innings based on live match stats.

2) Clean front-end with dropdown menus for seamless input selection.

3) Real-time score prediction powered by a trained machine learning model.

4) Encoders handled via Joblib serialization for consistent input processing.
